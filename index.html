                <p>Hi, my name is Lauren Browning. My family and I live in Idaho Falls. My husband and I have 3 children.
                    I love to read, and have a major sweet tooth.

                <p>Idaho is located in the North west part of the US. There is quite a bit of snow in the winter, and a beautiful summer. There are a lot of outdoor activities available to do in Idaho. Idaho is quite conservative, and has a pretty large LDS population.</p>
