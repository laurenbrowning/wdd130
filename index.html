                <p>Hi, my name is Lauren Browning. I grew up in Shelley, Idaho where the mascot is a Russet (yes, the mighty potato). I pitched for the HS softball team, and had a blast. I attended BYU-I after graduating HS in 2009, and have an associates. I did a semester teaching English in Ukraine in 2011. My Husband and I got married in 2012. Then I attended Rexburg College of Massage Therapy in Rexburg. We moved to Richmond Virginia for my husband's job after he graduated. We moved back to Idaho about 5 years ago, and now my family and I live in Idaho Falls. My husband and I have 3 children. We love to spend time with both sets of Grandparents who are near by. 
                    I love to read, and have a major sweet tooth. Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

                <p>Idaho is located in the North west part of the US. There is quite a bit of snow in the winter, and a beautiful summer. There are a lot of outdoor activities available to do in Idaho. Idaho is quite conservative, and has a pretty large LDS population.</p>
